# The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then
# generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to
# complete the challenge.

# Demo
# https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day5-demo/

# Easy Version
# Generate the password in sequence. Letters, then symbols, then numbers. If the
# user wants 4 letters 2 symbols and 3 numbers, then the password might look like
# this: fgdx$*924

# You can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and
# all the numbers follow each other as well. Try to solve this problem first.

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

print("Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!")
nr_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
nr_symbols = int(input(f"How many symbols would you like?\n"))
nr_numbers = int(input(f"How many numbers would you like?\n"))

# ***My code begins here***

import random
from random import SystemRandom  #For the Hard Version

password = ""

for _ in range(0, nr_letters):
    password += random.choice(letters)

for _ in range(0, nr_symbols):
    password += random.choice(symbols)

for _ in range(0, nr_numbers):
    password += random.choice(numbers)

print(password)

# Hard Version
# When you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version.
# In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a
# pattern. So the example above might look like this: x$d24g*f9

# And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers,
# and letters are different. This will make the password more difficult for hackers
# to crack.

# The essential skill of a good programmer is using Google to find what you need.
# Your brain is for thinking, not memorising functions! You will need to Google to
# solve this project on the hard level. If you get stuck, check the hint below for
# what to Google.
